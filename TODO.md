# TODO - Active Sprint Tracker
**Last Updated:** January 25, 2026 (Evening)

**Follow the guidelines in AGENTS.MD in project root exactly.**

## Current Focus: Immediate Polish
Goal: Refine the full testable battle loop now that Phases 5–6 are complete.

### Immediate Polish
- [x] Refine tally steppers in ActiveGameScreen (e.g., +1/3 kills, survived auto-check)
- [ ] Add agenda progress indicators (current vs target)
- [ ] Improve group/component framing visuals for tallies/agendas
- [ ] Add D6 roller widget for OOA tests (with reroll button, Epic Hero skip)

## Completed This Session / Archive
- **Immediate Polish (Jan 25):** Kill tally XP progress indicator, Survived/Destroyed segmented toggle
- **Phases 5–6 (Jan 25):** Post-game screen complete with notes field, XP calculation, rank progression, tally updates, Drive backup prompt
- Phases 1–4: ActiveGameScreen created/routed, Game init on deploy, placeholder agendas + tally/tier UI, component listing/controls, game completion stub, saving
- UX batch (Jan 24): conditional buttons, confirmations, Warlord hide, detachment filters, Drive v1.1 campaigns
- Data: Tyranids units, icon batches, validation/sanitization

## Next After This Phase
- Roster assembly polish (checkbox OOB → named save)
- Additional requisitions (Supply increase, Rearm/Resupply, Fresh Recruits)
- Fill remaining isCharacter/isEpicHero flags + high-play faction units (Orks, Necrons, etc.)

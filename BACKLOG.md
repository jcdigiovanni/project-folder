# BACKLOG.md
**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026 (Post-TODO Sprint Alignment)

## Bugs (Remaining – Low Priority)
- **BUG-008 (Low)**: Minor async/sync mismatches in unit selection UI (occasional lag on OOB load)
- **BUG-009 (Low)**: Navigation issues on crusade disband (rare backstack overflow)

## Enhancements (Remaining – Polish Debt)
- **ENH-004 (Low)**: Add optional sound effects to D6 roller (toggle in settings; non-essential)
- **ENH-005 (Low)**: Export campaign summary as basic text/CSV (beyond full narrative tools)

## Deferred / Honor-System Items (RP Spend Only – No Enforcement)
- **DEF-001 (Low)**: Stub "Rearm and Resupply" (1 RP deduct, toast/log "Wargear swapped – honor system", no unit/wargear change or UI)
- **DEF-002 (Low)**: Stub "Maintenance and Upgrades" (if rules require; similar RP-only pattern: deduct 1–2 RP, log event)

## Data Fills (Separate Generation)
- **DATA-001 (Medium)**: Full Deathwatch unit data (MFM v3.8 page 19 reference; extract points/flags like prior factions – generate externally)

# BACKLOG.md
**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026 (Post-TODO Sprint Alignment)

## Bugs (Remaining – Low Priority)
- **BUG-011 (Low)**: Trying to take focus off of the soft keyboard on Adroid app causes currently selected options and text to be cleared on the Add Unit screen
- **BUG-012 (Low)**: In order to make edits to a unit (ie: change custom name) that is a part of a unit group, the unit first needs to be dropped from the group.  The unit can then be upgraded and then re-added to the group.  This is a clunky and unintuitive workflow

## Enhancements (Remaining – Polish Debt)

## Deferred / Honor-System Items (RP Spend Only – No Enforcement)
- **DEF-001 (Low)**: Stub "Rearm and Resupply" (1 RP deduct, toast/log "Wargear swapped – honor system", no unit/wargear change or UI)
- **DEF-002 (Low)**: Stub "Maintenance and Upgrades" (if rules require; similar RP-only pattern: deduct 1–2 RP, log event)

## Data Fills (Separate Generation)
- **DATA-001 (Medium)**: Full Deathwatch unit data (MFM v3.8 page 19 reference; extract points/flags like prior factions – generate externally)

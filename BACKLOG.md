**Last Updated:** January 25, 2026 (Late Evening – Post-Sprint Integration)

## Bugs (Remaining)
- **BUG-001 (High)**: Exit button on bottom ribbon doesn't function
- **BUG-005 (High)**: Deleting all local data still does not clear out campaigns
- **BUG-006 (Low)**: When selecting the first unit to add - making it a character with Warlord AND Renowned Heroes selected on... the unit does not seem to save to the permanent roster.
- **BUG-007 (Low)**: While adding a new unit group to the OOB - If a name is selected but no units are, validation properly requires units to be added, but the name field seems to lose itself... the name is still in the bar, but the add button does not see it until the text bar is interacted with again

## Enhancements (Remaining)
- **ENH-002 (Low)**: Consistent button styling across dialogs/popups (colors, padding, elevation)
